  <title>A lightweight RPC library based on XML and HTTP</title>
  <description>XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
Internet. It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends it
to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.

This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C.
